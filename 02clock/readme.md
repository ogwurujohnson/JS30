# JavaScript30 Challenge 02 - Analog clock
This simple website displays an analog clock over an elegant background.

## Lessons learned

Personally this particular exercise was kind of tough, figuring out how to convert time to degrees for the css class rotate to use. Really enjoyed the lesson upto the part where i needed to change the `transition` of the hands.

I typed the code following the video, but was able to implement the minute and hour hand myself, but still had the issue of converting time to degrees.

In terms of customization, I changed the picture used by Wes into one with a sunset. I also swapped the white outline of the clock and the black hands with colors that are visible in the image.
