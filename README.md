Codes from the 30 days JavaScript Challenge

This repo contains all the challenges in the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course organized by Wes Bos.
Most of them contain some slight changes and each folder has a `readme.md` file with lessons learned in that particular challenge.

My full impressions of the course would be made available on [Medium](#) and the live demonstrations are on [my website](https://ogwurujohnson.github.io/J30/).
